Selected Gambatte as the likeliest candidate for an Emuhost Gameboy (over SameBoy and Gearboy).
Seems it is also split on the proper lines, we only need libgambatte.

Try truly from scratch, don't bother with sinamas's build scripts or app layers.
Try without scons too.

Took libgambatte and common from Gambatte.

New directory src/libgambatte/providers for things implemented by Gambatte's app layer:
  usec_t getusecs();
  void usecsleep(usec_t usecs);
  
OK! It builds without much fuss.
Look at its SDL implementation and start wiring up...
See GB.runFor() in gambatte.h -- a work of art, it does and explains exactly what we need.
Beware, when he says "sample" he means "frame".

I guess Gameboys emit audio at 2 MHz???
[x] Update Emuhost to allow that crazy rate.
  - Need a way larger buffer in aucvt. Might need to adapt there.
[x] Provide input.
